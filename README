Repository for metrics api.


To generate the documentation, you need sphinx (http://sphinx.pocoo.org/).

    $ cd ./doc
    $ make html

The documentation should be generated at ./doc/build/html

---
Added more test scripts at test/
They should be run within that directory (i.e. cd to test/)

test/test_matplotlib.py requires matplotlib for full effect.
For Ubuntu, it's packaged as python-matplotlib
